    "fullDescription": "Developed by Tokyo-based startup Tsubame Industries, Archax is a groundbreaking pilotable robot that brings the world of science fiction into reality. Standing at 4.5 meters tall and weighing 3.5 tons, Archax features a humanoid upper body with two arms and hands designed to mimic human movements. The robot offers two operation modes: an upright 'Robot Mode' and a 'Vehicle Mode' that allows it to travel at speeds of up to 10 km/h. Controlled from a cockpit located in the chest area, the pilot uses two joysticks, two pedals, and a touchscreen interface to maneuver the robot. The cockpit is equipped with four monitors displaying feeds from nine external cameras, providing a comprehensive view of the surroundings.",
